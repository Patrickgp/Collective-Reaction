# Description

This is a demonstration of my proficiency with MongoDB. The challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users could share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. I utilized Express.js, a MongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM. Included is a walkthrough video demonstration.
